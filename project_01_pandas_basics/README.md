# Project 01 – Pandas Basics

## Goal
Build confidence using pandas by analyzing a real CSV dataset from scratch.

## What this project demonstrates
- Loading and inspecting data with pandas
- Understanding dataset structure
- Computing basic statistics
- Writing results to an output file

## Why this matters
This project is focused on hands-on confidence and ownership, not advanced ML.

## Key Business Insights

1. The average tip percentage across all transactions is ~16%, which can be used as a baseline expectation.

3. Saturday dinner has the lowest average tip percentage, suggesting higher traffic but lower relative tipping.
4. Tip behavior varies more by day than by meal time, which could inform staffing or incentive strategies.
