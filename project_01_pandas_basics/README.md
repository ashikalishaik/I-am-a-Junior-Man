# Project 01 – Pandas Basics

## Goal
Build confidence using pandas by analyzing a real CSV dataset from scratch.

## What this project demonstrates
- Loading and inspecting data with pandas
- Understanding dataset structure
- Computing basic statistics
- Writing results to an output file

## Why this matters
This project is focused on hands-on confidence and ownership, not advanced ML.

## Key Business Insights

1. The average tip percentage across all transactions is ~16%, which can be used as a baseline expectation.
2. Friday lunch shows the highest tip percentage (~19%), indicating stronger customer generosity during this time window.
3. Saturday dinner has the lowest average tip percentage, suggesting higher traffic but lower relative tipping.
4. Tip behavior varies more by day than by meal time, which could inform staffing or incentive strategies.
5. Understanding tip percentage trends can help restaurants optimize staff allocation and service focus.

## Visual Analysis

### Average Tip Percentage by Day (Bar Chart)
This chart compares average tipping behavior across different days.
Friday shows the highest average tip percentage, suggesting stronger customer generosity compared to other days.
Such insights can help businesses plan staffing or promotions around high-performing days.

### Tip Percentage Distribution by Day (Box Plot)
The box plot highlights variability in tipping behavior for each day.
Some days show wider distributions, indicating inconsistent tipping patterns.
Understanding variability helps assess risk rather than relying only on averages.
