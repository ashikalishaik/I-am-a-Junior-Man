# I-am-a-Junior-Man
I am regaining my confidence that I am equal to a Senior IT Manager

## Day 1
- Installed: Python, Git, VS Code
- Created a GitHub repository
- Created a folder using `mkdir`
- Created a Python file (`echo "" > hello.py`)
- Edited the file using VS Code (`code hello.py`)
- Ran the script using Python
- Git workflow: `git status` → `git add .` → `git commit` → `git push`

## Day 2
- Built and ran a mini calculator script (supports + - * /, handles division by zero)
- Practiced terminal workflow: run → status → commit → push
- Built Project 01 using pandas without AI-generated code
- Loaded CSV, inspected schema, checked missing values, generated summary report
- Saved output to output/summary.txt


- ### Project 01 – Pandas Basics

- #### Goal
- Build confidence using pandas by analyzing a real CSV dataset from scratch.

- #### What this project demonstrates
- Loading and inspecting data with pandas
- Understanding dataset structure
- Computing basic statistics
- Writing results to an output file

- #### Why this matters
- This project is focused on hands-on confidence and ownership, not advanced ML.

## Day 3
- Loaded CSV, inspected schema, checked missing values, generated summary report
- Saved output to output/insights_v2.txt
- DATA.GROUPBY("","")[""].APPLY().SORT()
- DATA[""]=DATA[""]/DATA[""]*100
