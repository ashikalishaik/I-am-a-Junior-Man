# I-am-a-Junior-Man
I am regaining my confidence that I am equal to a Senior IT Manager

## Day 1
- Installed: Python, Git, VS Code
- Created a GitHub repository
- Created a folder using `mkdir`
- Created a Python file (`echo "" > hello.py`)
- Edited the file using VS Code (`code hello.py`)
- Ran the script using Python
- Git workflow: `git status` → `git add .` → `git commit` → `git push`

## Day 2
- Built and ran a mini calculator script (supports + - * /, handles division by zero)
- Practiced terminal workflow: run → status → commit → push
